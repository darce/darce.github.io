This collaboration involved transforming static designs into responsive, pixel-perfect code, ensuring high-quality online presentations.
A notable achievement was prototyping and developing the Marketing Department&#x27;s first direct mail, which used CSS3 animations to enhance user engagement and visual appeal.</p>
